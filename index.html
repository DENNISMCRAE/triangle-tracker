    <h1>TRIANGLES TRACKER </h1>
    <h2>Equilateral Triangle</h2>
    <p> An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
      In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular;
      that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°. </p>
    <h2> Isosceles Triangle </h2>
    <p> An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length.
      Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length,
      the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.</p>
    <h2>Scalene Triangle</h2>
    <p> A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides. </p>
